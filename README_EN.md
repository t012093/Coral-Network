## ðŸ’« Overview

Open Coral Network is a decentralized social network (pro-social media) designed to facilitate local community formation through the internet.

### Why "Coral"?

Our model is inspired by coral reef ecosystems:
- Harmony with nature and integration with local regions
- Attracting diverse "fish" (community members)
- Creating a circular society
- Nurturing community roots in local areas

### Project Features

1. **Diverse Professional Community**
   - Programming, AI, IT
   - Art, Music, Food
   - Gathering of professionals and learners across fields
   - Learning environment based on mutual respect

2. **Quality Connections**
   - Smart matching for meaningful encounters
   - Building lasting relationships
   - Project-based collaboration
   - Rebuilding authentic human connections

3. **Future-Oriented Initiatives**
   - Integration with AR Urban Development
   - AR Design for local cities
   - High synergy with community values

### Our Mission

- Encourage worldwide participation
- Provide services free of charge as an NPO
- Restore authentic human connections
- Create a global movement

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

    B --> E[Circular Society]
    C --> E

    E --> F[Sustainable<br>Communities]
```

While leveraging technology, we aim to build communities that value authentic human connections. Like a coral reef ecosystem, we strive to create sustainable communities that are rooted in their localities and in harmony with nature.
