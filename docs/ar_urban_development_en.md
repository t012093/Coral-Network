# AR Urban Development Project

[æ—¥æœ¬èªžç‰ˆ](ar_urban_development.md)

> ðŸ“‹ **Overview**  
> This project aims to leverage AR (Augmented Reality) technology to solve urban and regional challenges while creating new value. With applications spanning regional revitalization, tourism promotion, disaster prevention, and education, we provide AR experiences that enrich people's lives.

> ðŸŒŸ **Background**  
> Modern cities face numerous challenges, including population decline, aging society, infrastructure deterioration, and environmental issues. Introducing innovative technology is essential to address these challenges. AR technology has the potential to provide new solutions by overlaying digital information onto the real world, expanding people's perception and behavior.
